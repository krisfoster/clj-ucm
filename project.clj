  :description "Simple library wrapping around the Oracle RIDC client library fo UCM.
                This has been developed and tested against UCM 10Gr3 - may work with the new version but haven't tried it yet.
                The one Oracle library is not available through clojars - or jarvana
                so it needs to be added to you local maven repository as below:

                  $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./ridc/oracle-ridc-client-10g.jar -DgroupId=oracle -DartifactId=ridc -Dversion=10.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true

               The above bit of script requires that the jar is downloaded and placed in the named directories. They 
               can be downloaded from - accept the the license agreement and click on the link to download Content Integration Suite:
